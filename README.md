# CUDA-CUDNN_learning
Learning the CUDNN library and how to develop in CUDA with what is essentially C++ but with added functions and annotations distinguishing them from the host code, plus annotations for distinguishing different types of data memory that exists on the GPU. NVCC (Nvidia CUDA Compiler) compiles the CUDA source files (.cu) containing the host code and device functions.
