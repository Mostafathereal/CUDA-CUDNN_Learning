# learning_CUDNN
Learning CUDNN with a language that is essentially C++ but with some annotations distinguishing them from the host code, plus annotations for distinguishing different types of data memory that exists on the GPU. NVCC (Nvidia CUDA Compiler) compiles the CUDA source files (.cu) containing the host code and device functions.
